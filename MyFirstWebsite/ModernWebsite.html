            <h2>An Angelfish's Natural Habitat</h2>
            <p>Angelfish are native to a large area of tropical South America, including much of the Amazon River system. In their natural habitat, they are found almost exclusively in quiet, slow moving water. In the wild they prefer dimly lit areas, under overhanging vegetation or among trees that have fallen into the river.</p>
            
            <h2>Water Requirements for Angelfish</h2>
            <p>Captive raised angelfish accept a wide range of water conditions, although they prefer slightly warmer water. pH should be between 6.8 and 7.8, with hardness between 3° and 8° dKH (54 to 145 ppm). Temperature is best kept between 78° and 84° F. Maintain good filtration and perform water changes of 10% weekly or 25% every other week an Aqueon Aquarium Water Changer or Siphon Vacuum Gravel Cleaner.</p>

            <h2>Another Section</h2>
            <p>Angelfish will feed at the surface or mid-water, however, in nature they often forage along the bottom looking for worms and small crustaceans. They are omnivores and will thrive on Aqueon Tropical Flakes, Color Flakes, Tropical Granules and Shrimp Pellets. Frozen and live foods can also be fed as treats or to help induce spawning. For best results, rotate their diet daily and feed only what they can consume in 2 to 3 minutes, once or twice a day. </p>
            <h2>Angelfish Breeding Level – Intermediate</h2>
            <p>Adult angelfish will pair off and spawn readily. They clean a flat vertical surface on which to lay their eggs and chase other fish away. Spawning occurs with the female laying rows of eggs on the prepared surface and the male following, fertilizing them. Unfortunately, most captive angelfish have lost the rearing instinct and usually eat their own eggs or fry. Breeders induce pairs to spawn on vertical pieces of slate or other material, which they remove to hatchery aquariums for raising.</p>
